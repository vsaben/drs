## Overview

Master's thesis:  Model building and evaluation

This repository sets out the tensorflow scripts used to:
* Preprocess datasets 
* Specify models
* Train models
* Evaluate models

from a command line. 

This thesis uses YOLO-based networks to generate region proposals for a mask CNN network. These region proposals will be evaluated separately as object detections, and as part of a larger CNN multi-task network.   

## Region Models to be evaluated:

1. YOLOv3
    - Normal
    - Slim
2. YOLOv3-tiny
    - Normal
    - FPN
